## Overview
The BI Implementation for Food Inspection Analysis project focuses on integrating and analyzing food inspection results from Illinois and Texas. This project aims to ensure data accuracy, streamline data processing, and provide actionable insights through comprehensive visualization, ultimately aiding in improving food safety standards.

## Problem Statement
Food inspection data from different cities is often inconsistent and difficult to analyze, leading to inefficiencies in monitoring food safety. The lack of unified data formats and comprehensive reporting hinders the ability to identify trends and make informed decisions. This project addresses these challenges by integrating data, ensuring consistency, and providing detailed analysis and visualization.

## Technology stack
- **ER Studio**: Schema design and data modeling.
- **Talend**: ETL processes to load data into fact and dimension tables.
- **Alteryx/Python**: Data profiling and analysis.
- **Azure SQL**: Data staging and integration.
- **Snowflake**: Secure and robust data storage and handling.
- **Tableau**: Visualization and KPI reporting.

## Project Description
Our system comprises these interconnected modules:

**Data Modelling with ER Studio:**
- Designed and implemented a star schema for efficient data integration and querying.
- Ensured consistent data modeling across different data sources.

**Data Profiling and ETL Processes:**
- Utilized Alteryx and Python for initial data profiling and cleaning.

**ETL and Data Integration:**
- Developed Talend jobs to load data into fact and dimension tables, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.


**Visualization with Tableau:**
- Leveraged Tableau for comprehensive visualization and analysis of integrated food inspection data.
- Developed KPIs to monitor trends and patterns in inspection outcomes, enabling strategic insights and decision-making for restaurant and food establishment safety.
